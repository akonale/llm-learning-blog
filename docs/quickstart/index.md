## Getting Started
GPTs, LLaMAs, DeepSeek models, Agentic AI, RAGsâ€”thereâ€™s an explosion of tools, coding interfaces, and workflows in the LLM space. 
Itâ€™s easy to feel lost. Where do I even start? More importantly, what am I trying to achieve?

### My Goals
- Develop a solid understanding of what LLMs can and cannot do.
- Understand the various abstractions used to build applications on top of LLMs.
- Gain fundamental knowledge of how to use these abstractions effectively.

### A Crude Understanding of LLMs
Before diving into building, I needed a foundational grasp of what LLMs actually are. A great starting point for me was this Stanford lecture on LLMs:

I donâ€™t have a strong background in ML, but I still found this lecture helpful. 
At first, I didnâ€™t understand a lot of what was being discussed. 
However, as I progressed, I started recalling concepts from this lecture and came back to it for reference.
