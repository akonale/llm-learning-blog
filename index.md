# Learning LLMs: A Software Developerâ€™s Journey ðŸš€

LLMs are evolving at an insane pace. Every day, new tools and models emerge, dominating tech discussions and even making it to mainstream news. The AI race is heating up, and keeping up with it all can feel overwhelming. With so much informationâ€”some genuine, some just marketing buzz, and some outright clickbaitâ€”itâ€™s hard to separate the signal from the noise.

As a software developer, I know that LLMs are already reshaping the industry, and understanding them is no longer optional. Thatâ€™s why I started this journeyâ€”to build a solid foundation, make sense of different abstractions, and figure out how these tools fit into real-world use cases.

This blog is my attempt to share what I learn: my approach, the materials I find useful, and insights that might help others on the same path. While itâ€™s primarily aimed at software developers, I believe anyone curious about LLMs can find value here.

Letâ€™s cut through the noise, build real knowledge, and explore the world of LLMsâ€”one step at a time.

## How to Read This Blog
I will be starting with the basics and walking you through my thought process, including the challenges I faced and the mistakes I made. Comments and discussions are welcome!

Iâ€™ll share code snippets as I learn new concepts. This blog is hands-on, focusing on practical learning.

I am using Python for development, so most of the examples and implementations will be in Python.
